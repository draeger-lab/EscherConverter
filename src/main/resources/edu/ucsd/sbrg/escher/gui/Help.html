    <h1>Escher Converter Online Help</h1>
    
    The program EscherConverter reads files that have been generated with the
    modeling tool Escher and converts it into standardized community data
    formats.
    
    Currently available output formats are
    <a href="http://sbml.org" target="_blank">SBML</a> and
    <a href="http://sbgn.org" target="_blank">SBGN-ML</a>.
    
    This program comes with a limited editing functionality of the network
    images.
     
    Any changes made by the user in this display are, however, not synchronized
    with the SBML or SBGN data objects. 
    In other words, these changes will not have any effect when exporting the
    file to one of these formats.
    This program entirely relies on the layouts as these are given in the Escher
    pathway maps.
